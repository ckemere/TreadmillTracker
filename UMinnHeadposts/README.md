This is a design adapted from that developed by Ghanbari et al and presented in the paper
["Cortex-wide neural interfacing via transparent polymer
skulls"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09488-0) from the lab of Suhasa
Kodandaramaiah at the University of Minnesota. Various curves have been replaced with simpler
splines, mounting holes stretched to 5.5mm, and the 3D printed base and metal frames have been
made to be symmetrical (the 3D printed base at least has a symmetrical hole).
