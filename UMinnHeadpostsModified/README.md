This is a design adapted from that developed by Ghanbari et al and presented in the paper
"Cortex-wide neural interfacing via transparent polymer skulls" (found on the [BioRxiv
here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/387142v2) from the lab of Suhasa
Kodandaramaiah at the University of Minnesota. Various curves have been replaced with
simpler splines, mounting holes stretched to 5.5mm, and the 3D printed base and metal
frames have been made to be symmetrical (the 3D printed base at least has a symmetrical
hole).
